## Motivation

## Informative Explanation

<!--Provide an informative explanation of proposal. 
This is intended to be read by someone who wishes to understand the proposal but may not have advanced technical background.

## Normative Text

### Registries

The ACI Specification Project shall maintain a series of registries, to record important information for both machine and human users.

The registries shall be recorded in csv format.

The information recorded in each registry depend on the registry, but each registration shall, regardless of registry include the following information:
* The machine-usable identifier for the registration,
* The human readable public name of the registration,
* The name and contact of the registrar that issued the registration. 

### Registrars

The Clever-ISA Project and Lightning Creations shall be deemed the registrars of the ACI Registries. 
As appropriate, the Core Interest Groups of these two registrars shall have authority to make registrations on the behalf of the registrars, 
where such registrations are not deemed to require an RFC. Primary registries are divided between these groups, appropriately.
The creation of a registry is by RFC only.

### Registrar Secretary

The Core Interest Groups shall together appoint a Registrar Secretary to manage the registries. 

## Security Considerations

Each Registry is released publicly and may contain some personal information. 
Both registrars and registrants should take care that such information is added to the registry. The Registrar Secretary

### Normative References

<!--List all documents cited normatively here. 
A Normative Reference is a reference within the main text (Normative Text section, Security Considerations, or Registry Impacts) for the meaningful content within.
For example, if you use definitions from another specification, it would be a normative reference.
